GAME IDEAS:
start with 2D for simplicity
- movable character that can pick up objects
    - implement a struct for boxes so you can have more than one (this will make you learn how to use structs lol)
    - each time you get a box to objective, you get a point!
    - once you reach 5 points (or some arbitrary quantity), you win!
