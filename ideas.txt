GAME IDEAS:
start with 2D for simplicity
- movable character that can pick up objects
    - implement a struct for boxes so you can have more than one. Box struct
      should contain coordinates and size? or really just coordinates and have
	const variable for all box sizes (for now at least)
	-> you need a function that creates a box struct and draws a brown
	rectangle at the coordinates of the created box struct. Try and get
	this function and the box struct working for now I guess
	^^^ current feature to be implemented
    	-> I think that you need functions that take box structs as
	you need like an indicator on each box that says if it's picked up or
	not. 
	-> The collision detection should only be run with the player? it
	checks every frame if it has collided with a box, then updates the boxes bool
	value to indicate that the box has been picked up which will trigger
	the box moving with the player. maybe turn collision detection off at
	this point so that player can't carry multiple boxes at once?
	-> code to write
		-> box struct and list of boxes
		-> collision detector for player
		-> collision detector for objective (when a box collides with

objective, delete the box and increment
		->
    - each time you get a box to objective, you get a point!
    - once you reach 5 points (or some arbitrary quantity), you win!
